# Evolutionary Event Ontology Knowledge(EEOK)

## Introduction


We build EEOK that leverages the evolutionary event knowledge represented in standard ontology language OWL for representing a set of evolutionary patterns.

For a detailed description and experimental results, please refer to our paper: [Event prediction based on evolutionary event ontology knowledge](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X20311778). 

For the code of event evolution knowledge generation and event prediction experiments, please refer to our repository: [KGEvetPred](https://github.com/RingBDStack/KGEvetPred).
